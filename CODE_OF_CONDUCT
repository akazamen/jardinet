--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                   
The code of conduct for this project is this.

1) CHAUVINISM 
Don't be chauvinistic. This includes partisan politics. This will create drama, 
and will make you look dumb or socially inept to the eyes of the team. 

2) TECHNICAL PREFERENCES
You can have technical preferences. You don't like systemd because of... 
reasons? That's ok. You prefer JSON instead of YAML because it looks prettier in 
your editor of choice? That's ok too. But be prepared to defend your choice with 
good arguments if challenged, and be open to change if your position is weaker.

3) BE POLITE 
Don't be mean (that is, don't make efforts to anger another person). You can
always critizise politely. For this reason, if you want to critizise someone, 
read your complaint twice before posting it. 

4) NO IRRELEVANT DRAMA 
Twitter posts, comments on social media, from politicians or "influencers", etc, 
have no importance. If a member of a team made a post somewhere that might be 
considered insensitive, it is irrelevant too.

5) DON'T TAKE OFFENSE EASILY
Oh, so this person made an 'ableist' comment and you are offended? That is 
really sad, and irrelevant. Are you mad that someone said 'master-slave', or 
'blind test'? Irrelevant.

6) BE CLASSY 
(Optional) Please don't curse. Not really mandatory, we are just asking.

7) THE EXCEPTION : BEING MEAN-SPIRITED. 
If you act in a disruptive way, creating internal drama or avoidable technical 
problems, we will consider you an enemy of the project. Even if your code is 
great. But remember, sincere, intelectually honest apologies and changes in 
disruptive attitudes are always welcome!
